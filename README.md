# AVR-Labview-based-SCADA-for-DC-motor-PID-control

Supervision and control platform to manage speed of a DC motor, for academic purposes.

Project files included:

Labview desing blocks; Microcontroller code; Hardware schematics.

Features included:

SCADA based software, that includes real-time intuitive visualization of the system variables; Computer based PID controller algorithm, wicth allows easy and dynamic modifications on PID parameters; Hardware formed by an Arduino board used together with a power interface and a signal aquisition circuit.
